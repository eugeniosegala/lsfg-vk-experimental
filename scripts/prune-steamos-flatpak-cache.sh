Usage: scripts/prune-steamos-flatpak-cache.sh [--confirm]

Reports the persistent Flatpak development cache used by Decky's SteamOS
development commands. With no arguments this is a dry run: nothing is removed.

Options:
  --confirm   Remove only this checkout's Flatpak download cache and temporary
              staging directory.
  -h, --help  Show this help.

This never removes native build trees, the installed Decky plugin, its bundled
Flatpak files, or your normal user Flatpak installation. A later dev:flatpaks
or dev:e2e run will download the Flatpak SDK/runtime dependencies again.
